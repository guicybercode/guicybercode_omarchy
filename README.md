# guicybercode_omarchy
Dark discipline with crimson focus. guicybercode_omarchy leans on deep blacks, oxide reds, and muted metals for a calm-but-ready workspace. Workspaces display Mandarin numerals, and the current desktop is highlighted with a subtle Jesus cross motif so you always know where you are.

## Highlights
- Mandarin numerals for workspace indicators.
- Cross marker for the active desktop.
- Single bundled wallpaper to keep the setup consistent.
- Tuned for terminals, bars, and launchers with the same palette across configs.
